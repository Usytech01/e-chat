This project is a TypeScript-driven Next.js application designed to merge and visually align multiple images into a single, clean output. It provides a structured interface where users can upload images, preview transformations, and generate a refined merged result. The front end is built with React and enhanced with Framer Motion to ensure smooth visual interactions and a polished user experience.

All components are written using enforced React.FC<Props> patterns for consistency and type safety. The UI design follows high-fidelity Figma standards, making the layout clear, modern, and easy to extend. The architecture is modular, maintainable, and ready for scaling with additional features such as backend processing, storage, or automated alignment logic.
